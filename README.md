# Why does delta-9-Tetrahydrocannbinoid act as a partial agonist for Cannabinoid Receptors?
This repository contains MSM feature file, final MSM object, codes and pdb structure files, and bootstrap samples used to genarate figures and calculations in the manuscript.

## features.pkl
This file can be downloaded from https://uofi.box.com/s/g1x5vfukl6492jtuzpx7u1rbyki2t85z. This file is a list of arrays where each array represents a MD trajectory. It contains 23 features for each MD trajectory used to build the final MSM. 

## final_MSM_obj.pkl
This file can be downloaded from https://uofi.box.com/s/hzzgzq0xw1tcgsjlnecklajpjdtmm4ma. It contains optimal MSM object with 200 clusters and 20 ns lagtime. 

## bootstraping
This folder can be downloaded from https://uofi.box.com/s/88nzwam5ygout7x3wvswxzlbcfkqxky3. It contains 200 bootstrap samples and corresponding MSMs with same state index as reference MSM.
